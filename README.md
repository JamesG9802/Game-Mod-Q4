# Game-Mod-Q4
This is a mod turning Quake 4 into a low-quality version of Slay The Spire. 
The mod can be launched by using the shortcut or by going into Quake 4 and selecting 'it266_mod" in the mod menu.

The game follows the same rules as Slay the Spire:
- The player always goes first.
- The player draws 5 cards at the start of each turn.
- The player's hand is discarded at the end of each turn.
- The player has 3 energy to spend on cards each turn.
- Each battle ends when the enemies all run out of health.
